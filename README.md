The eccentric circle is a circle animation. 
Two circles have the same radius and are situated with two different center positions. 
Both are expanding and collapsing alternatively. 
The creative thing is when one circle collapses completely inside another. 
Two Words "Life" and "Work" are written inside the circles. 
It generally tells the meaning of a strong mindset that work is a small part of life.
